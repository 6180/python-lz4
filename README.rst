Introduction
============
This package provides python bindings for the `lz4 compression library
<https://cyan4973.github.io/lz4//>`_ by Yann Collet.

At this time the project contains bindings for the LZ4 block format
and the LZ4 frame format. A future relase will implement support for the LZ4
stream format would be readily accepted!
