Introduction
============
This package provides python bindings for the `lz4 compression library
<https://cyan4973.github.io/lz4//>`_ by Yann Collet.

At this time the project contains bindings for the LZ4 block format
and the LZ4 frame format. Patches implementing bindings for the LZ4
stream format would be readily accepted!
